This is an experimental android app to intercept the DNS lookup request and use our custom DoH (DNS over HTTPS)
The app contains only one page, where it displays a textview of response that was received from a request to "www.google.com" website using the "https://low.kahfguard.com" DNS Resolver.
These both addresses are hard-coded in the codebase. It might be changed into user input based dynamic system in future, insha Allah.
